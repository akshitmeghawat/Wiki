#Use`<H1>`tag only once

*###Introduction

Every page should include a single `<h1>` tag and follow descendance for other header tags as well. The `<h1>` tag should contain up to 150 characters of text that accurately summarises and describes the contents of the page.

*###Descendance of Header tags

If the page contains a significant amount of text, it should be organised with `<h2>` through `<h6>` subheadings that summarise and categorise the text that they precede.

*###*Search Engine Optimisation

Search engines rely on correctly used headings to determine the organisation and contents of a site.

####Example

```html <h1> Use H1 tag only once </h1>```
